## What is it
Live app: https://github.com/MiloszDun/practice-client-questionnaire

A simple questionnaire a client might fill when applying for a project – in this case, building a space telescope.

This is purely a coding practice – I didn't worry about design. My main focus is on validating user input, playing around with useContext and processing different types of data.

(For the sake of simplicity, new submissions are kept in useState – they disappear once you refresh the page.)

Thanks to @prz-szo for sending me the idea & offering feedback with issues!

## To run

Use `npm start` to run the app.
