## What is it
This is a small project to practice React. Przemek got it in one of his past job interviews, and recommended that I give it a go to test my skills.

The goal is to build a simple questionnaire that you could send to clients to ask for project requirements. Nothing too fancy â€“ it should ask for different types of inputs, and display past input at the bottom.

## To run

Use `npm start` to run the app.

## Potential improvements
- App keeps the new submissions in useState, so they disappear once you close the page. I could save it in a text file instead.
